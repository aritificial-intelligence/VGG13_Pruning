# This yaml file defines the layer-wise pruning ratio.
# The following code is an example, and you need to finish the whole file.
# You need to list all the layer names you that want to prune and provide corssesponding prune ratio.
# Due to the existence of BN layer, ReLU layer, and pooling layer, the numbers of adjacent conv layers are often not adjacent.
# For example, 
# the name of 1st conv layer in vgg13 is features.0.weight
# the name of 2nd conv layer in vgg13 is features.3.weight
# You need to find the layer name from the model.

# An empirical conclusion is that we prefer to not prune the first Conv layer and last FC layer,
# due to they are usually more sensitive to the pruning and have fewer number of weights.
