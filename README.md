1. **After applying the `prune_channels_after_filter_prune` function (further pruning the corresponding channels), what is the change in sparsity?**
2. **Will accuracy decrease, increase, or not change after applying the `prune_channels_after_filter_prune` function?**
3. **How does the sparsity in the pruned model compare to the original model?**
4. **How does the accuracy in the pruned model compare to the original model?**
5. **How do different pruning methods (e.g., unstructured pruning vs. filter pruning) affect model performance?**
6. **How can you ensure that the pruning procedure does not significantly degrade the model's accuracy?**
7. **How do you decide the pruning ratio for each layer in a model?**
8. **What are the advantages of iterative pruning over one-shot pruning?**
9. **How does the pruning method (OMP, IMP, etc.) influence the fine-tuning process?**
10. **How do you evaluate the effectiveness of pruning during training and after fine-tuning?**
